## Wireless Servo Control, with ESP as Access Point

### Usage: 
- Connect phone or laptop to "ESP_XXXX" wireless network, where XXXX is the ID of the robot
- Go to 192.168.4.1. 
- A webpage with four buttons should appear. Click them to move the robot.

### Installation: 
- In Arduino, go to Tools > ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload to upload the files from ./data to the ESP
- Then, in Arduino, compile and upload sketch to the ESP

### Requirements:
#### Arduino support for ESP8266 board
- In Arduino, add URL to Files > Preferences > Additional Board Managers URL.
- See https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-hookup-guide/installing-the-esp8266-arduino-addon

#### Websockets library
- To install, Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries... > Websockets > Install
- https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets

#### ESP8266FS tool
- To install, create "tools" folder in Arduino, download, and unzip. See
